1. Project Overview
This project aims to build an AI-driven budget management system that simplifies expense handling through voice and chat.  
By integrating Agora Conversational AI, the system allows users to add expenses, query spending, set financial goals, and receive insights—all through natural conversation.  
It solves the common problem of manual budgeting by offering automation, predictive analytics, and personalized financial coaching.
